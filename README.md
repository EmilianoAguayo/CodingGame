# Product Owner responsibilities (2/team) [non-coders]:
    •	Interact with website (can screenshare)
    •	Make tickets of requests (backlog features, quality improvements, test cases, etc)
    •	Pseudo-code (where possible), especially in detail/description of tickets 
    •	Investigate/clear road blocks of developers (additional requirements gathering, clarification, error reporting, etc)
    •	Import (copy/paste?) developer generated solutions into website, providing feedback on results/errors

# Developer responsibilities (2+/team):
    •	Code solutions based off of P.O.-made tickets in IDE of choice – python preferred! (NOT on website!)
    •	1 developer architects solution, 1 developer implements (no back seat driving!)
    •	Peer review implementation, refactoring as required
    •	Architect solution/developer implementation swaps per ticket/feature or every 15 minutes, whichever is sooner
